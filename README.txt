The cssSandpaper JavaScript library looks at the stylesheets in an HTML
document and, where possible, smooths out the browser differences between
CSS3 properties like transform, opacity, box-shadow and others.  This script
is not only useful for developers who want to support these CSS3 properties in IE (which
doesn't support it natively in older versions) but in other browsers which
implement their own vendor-specific variants of these properties.
